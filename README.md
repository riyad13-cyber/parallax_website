# Parallax Website

A simple parallax scrolling website project built with HTML and CSS.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of parallax effects in web design, where background images move at a different speed than the foreground content, creating a sense of depth and immersion.

## Features

- Smooth parallax background sections
- Responsive layout using modern CSS (flexbox, gap, etc.)
- Clean and organized HTML structure
- Customizable color schemes and backgrounds

## File Structure

- `inded.html` — The main HTML file containing the site structure and content sections.
- `style.css` — The stylesheet handling all layout, styling, and parallax effects.
- `/media/` — Folder for background images used in the parallax sections.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Make sure all files, including the `/media/` folder with images, are in the same directory.
3. Open `inded.html` in your web browser to view the site.

## Customization

- To change background images, replace the files in the `/media/` folder or update the `background-image` properties in `style.css`.
- Adjust colors, spacing, or font styles in `style.css` to match your branding.
